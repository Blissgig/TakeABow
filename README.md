# TakeABow
This is based on an art installation I saw in NYC back in 2011.   

This project requires a Microsoft Kinect.

The installation was by Adam Frank and was called "Performer".  Details: http://www.adamfrank.com/performer/performer.htm

I thought the MS Kinect would be a nice way to have this at home for everyone.  
There are five different reactions when you Take A Bow.
