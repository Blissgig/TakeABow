# TakeABow
This is based on an art installation I saw in NYC back in 2011.   There are two images included to show the enviroment.  Google Street view of the alley is available here: https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7561241,-73.9850675,3a,75y,236.78h,85.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1saHCAh5QQec754iO-MjKQgw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656

This project requires a Microsoft Kinect.

The audio files included come from various YouTube clips.  There are included as examples and the rights remain with the original owners.

The installation was by Adam Frank and was called "Performer".  Details: http://www.adamfrank.com/performer/performer.htm

I thought the MS Kinect would be a nice way to have this at home for everyone.  
There are five different audio reactions when you Take A Bow.
